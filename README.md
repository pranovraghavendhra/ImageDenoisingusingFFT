# ImageDenoisingusingFFT

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview: Frequency Domain Image Denoising using 2D FFT

- Implemented digital image denoising using 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
- Converted noisy images from the spatial domain to the frequency domain.
- Analyzed and suppressed high-frequency noise while preserving image structure.
- Designed and applied low-pass filters:
  - Ideal Circular Filter
  - Gaussian Filter
- Reconstructed denoised images using inverse FFT.
- Evaluated filtering effectiveness using visual and qualitative metrics.
- Demonstrated improved image clarity with minimal loss of detail.

## âœ… Conclusion

- 2D FFT-based filtering significantly reduced high-frequency noise in grayscale images.
- Gaussian low-pass filtering outperformed ideal filtering by preserving edges and reducing blur.
- Final image quality was improved by applying a median filter to remove residual noise.
